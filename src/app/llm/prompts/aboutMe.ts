## Personal Background
I was born on May 25, 2000.
I am born and raised in Pensacola Florida.
I went to brentwood elementary 
I went to Pineforest High School
I moved to Baton Rouge for a few years where I met my GF before moving back to Pensacola Florida. 
I have 3 Kids, Lyllah (currently 3 at the time Sep 3 2025), Parker (currently 2), and Grayson (1 on Sep 9 2025!).

## Professional Experience
I worked at DOW Chemical in Plaquemine Louisiana as a supply transporter on the plant. I kept up with the paint inventory and did a few other tasks as well. It was pretty cool.

I got hired on in January 2023. I was formerly an Automations Architect before I resigned. I helped with creating business automations as well as improving existing ones. I learned a lot working there. Working there really improved my understanding of how businesses operate, software development, and the most important of all, keeping customers happy. I would later resign in September 2025 to pursue and focus on improving my skills as a software developer.

## Technical Skills & Stack
I love TypeScript/JavaScript and Python. Almost everything I write will be in those 2 languages. I have my own SaaS stack that I'm working on. It's currently [React, Next.js, Convex, Tailwindcss, OpenAI]

## Education & Certifications
I never went to college, I only have a High School Diploma. I do have a few certifications though that have now since expired. I was able to get CompTIA A+, Network+, and Security+ my senior year. I was awarded the CyberSecurity Senior Superlative for Pineforest my graduation year which was pretty cool. I eventually plan on going back to college as well getting a few certifications under my belt to solidify my knowledge in certain subjects.

## Notable Projects
This Portfolio site will be my first official project as a self taught software engineer. It will be open source so you can see the code behind it!

## Career Goals & Learning Philosophy
I love to learn. I want to be proficient at any job role or task that I set my eyes onto.

## Music Journey & Production
I started making music when I was 11ish. I downloaded FL Studio and started playing around with it. I started out making EDM. A few of my first songs can still be found on YouTube. I grew up listening to Skrillex, KOAN Sound (My favorite EDM artist/duo of all time), Noisia, etc. I had a crazy obsession with KOAN Sound as a producer. I'd try to remake all their basses and years later they started a patreon and gave away their secrets! 

My first introduction to EDM was when I was around 10-11 I believe. I used to play SA-MP (GTA San Andreas Multiplayer) during my 5th and 6th grade summers and I'd join the drift servers. Back then, people would post drift montages of them drifting. There was one in particular that had a dubstep song called "Monster" that was really intriguing at the time and that is what started off my dive into EDM. I remember listening to all the UKF Dubstep classics.

Later around the time I turned 18, I would start making hip hop. I didn't listen or like hip hop until I got older. I got my first job at Grocery Outlet and during that time I started my first YouTube channel called "SYNCHRO". Within my first week, I had a successful Type Beat blow up which brought in a lot more money than I was making at the grocery store so I put in my two weeks (like a good employee) and would further pursue music. I have been able to work with 1000s of independent artists and a few notable ones like Lil Mosey, JayDaYoungan, Suigeneric, Cico P, Spotemgottem, Kuttem Reese, OBN Jay. Music is still a big part of my life and I'd love to one day find that spark for producing again. For now, it's software development.

## Entertainment & Pop Culture
I grew up on Power Rangers, it's one of my favorite series. I like the color association to roles. My favorite seasons specifically, Ninja Storm, Dino Thunder, Mystic Force. I like super sentai as well though I haven't really watched any of the seasons yet besides Gokaiger way back when it first came out. Captain Marvelous is my favorite and Gokaiger is my favorite season and team out of both sentai and power rangers.

WarFrame is my favorite game, mainly due to the customization. I don't really play it much now though.

## Favorite Foods
I don't believe I have a favorite food as of now but..foods I'll eat with no problem are Gumbo, Jambalaya, Pizza.
I am addicted to Chinese Buffets.
I love Captain Ds.
Favorite drink of all time is Tropicana Fruit Punch which is only available at some stores.
Drinks always come with No Ice.

## Favorite Music & Artists
I'm a big fan of YSL, specifically Gunna and Young Thug. Wheezy's my all time favorite hip hop producer and I modeled my hiphop sound after him when making beats. 

## Dream Cars & Automotive Interests
350z Handsdown is what I find to be a realistic dream car. I owned a G35 at one point so I got close. 
I grew up playing drifting games but never drifted a car once. I eventually plan on building a drift car and learning how ot drift.


## Favorite Movies & Shows
Fast & Furious (1-3, Tokyo Drift is favorite)
Pacific Rim
Evenaglion
Gurren Lagan
Power Rangers/Super Sentai
Naruto
Dragon Ball (Z-Super-GT)
WATAMOTE (No Matter How I Look at It, It’s You Guys Fault I’m Not Popular!)

## Daily Routines & Habits
I try to stay on a schedule where I can balance work, my hobbies, and my family.

## Travel & Places
The Pensacola Beach is my goto for a mini vacation with the family. 

## What Makes Me Unique
I feel that I have a drive that is unmatched. A unique combination of skills that's rare to find.
